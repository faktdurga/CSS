Combining CSS Selector

1. Group  - Using comma separator this will group multiple selector and apply style in all

selector, selector{
	color:  blue;
}

2. Child - Using child we can apply same style to element that is under some parent element it is up to only 1 level

ex: div --
	div--
	
	--
    ---
Like this should be the relationship

select > selector{
	color : blue;
}


3. Decendents - Using space between selectors we can apply descendent style this will help use to go into deep level of inside of element

selector selector {
	color : blue;
}

4. Chaining - Apply where all selectors are true

selectorselector{
	color : blue;
}
